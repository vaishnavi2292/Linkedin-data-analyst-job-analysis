# Linkedin-data-analyst-job-analysis
This project seeks to analyse the data analyst job listings found on LinkedIn. The aim of the jobs analysis is to find hidden insights about data analyst jobs such as what skills are most in demand by employers. Following that, I attempt to implement unsupervised Machine Learning by building a K-Means Clustering model.
